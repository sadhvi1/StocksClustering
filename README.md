Stock clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning that groups data based on similar characteristics. For example, stocks can be clustered based on their stock price performance, annualized average return, volatility, price-earnings ratio, and dividend rate.
The K-means algorithm is one unsupervised classification algorithm that can be used to cluster stocks. This algorithm groups objects into k groups based on their characteristics, minimizing the sum of the distances between each object and the group centroid
